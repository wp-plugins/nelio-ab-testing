Nelio A/B Testing is a WordPress service that helps you optimize your site
based on data, not opinions.


== Description ==

[Nelio A/B Testing](http://wp-abtesting.com) is a conversion optimization
service for your WordPress site. It helps you define, manage, and keep track of
A/B-testing experiments from within your WordPress' dashboard, creating a
lovely, integrated, and well-known user experience.

On the technical side, **any gathered information about experiments and
statistical calculus are performed and stored in Nelio's backend servers**. As
a result, the load in your WordPress server does not increase and can focus on
what matters to you: serving information to your visitors as quickly as
possible.

**Note:** Please keep in mind that [you will need an
account](http://wp-abtesting.com/subscription-plans/) to use our plugin (the
service includes a 15-day free trial period).


= Features =

* A/B and multivariate test of WordPress pages (title, content, page style,
page theme options...)
* A/B and multivariate test of WordPress posts (title, content, page style,
post theme options...)
* Select one or more alternative themes among the installed ones and test
which one works better!
* Fresh information about the evolution of the experiment every day
* Nice graphics about visitors, conversions, improvements, ...
* Definition, management, and tracking of experiments integrated in WordPress
* Gathered information about experiments and statistical calculus stored and
performed in Nelio's backend servers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need an A/B testing native WordPress solution? =

* **Easier learning curve.** No need to learn yet another tool. Everything
(from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is done from
the WordPress dashboard using the same interface you’re already familiar with.
* **Automatic improvement of the WP site.** A native WordPress solution is able
to automatically evolve your WordPress site. For instance, it can update the
site to reflect the winner alternative as soon as the results are statistically
significant. Instead, with a generic tool, once you have the winner, you´ll
need to back to WordPress and manually modify the posts to implement the
changes yourself.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The "testing unit" in a generic tool is the web
page since this the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access
to. Instead a native WordPress solution can access all your WordPress
components, including the menu, your widget configuration, theme,… so you can
choose to test a combination of these components (e.g. testing two different
menus across the site) instead a specific page.
* **More control.** What about showing the tests only to (un)registered users?
Or users with a certain role? This kind of control on the testing process can
only be done when the AB Testing tool has access to the internals of your
WordPress installation.
