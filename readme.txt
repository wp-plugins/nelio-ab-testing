= Reasons for choosing Nelio =

Take a look at the following reasons for choosing
Nelio A/B Testing!


= #1 - Native A/B Testing Solution for WordPress =

There's no [need to learn an external
tool](http://wp-abtesting.com/5-reasons-use-nelio-ab-testing/?fp=wordpress.org).
Define, manage, and track the progress of your experiments directly from within
WordPress. Nelio A/B Testing provides a **lovely and well-known user
interface** that simplifies the process of creating alternatives and applying
the winning ones.


= #2 - Create Alternative Content for your Pages (and Posts) =

When creating A/B experiments, the first things you'll want to test are the
pages of your website. Does this button work? Do my visitors go from the
landing page to my pricing page? What if I change this background image? Nelio
A/B Testing makes [page (and post) experiments super
easy](http://wp-abtesting.com/wordpress-splitmultivariate-testing-pages/?fp=wordpress.org)!


= #3 - Go beyond simple title tests&mdash;Test Headlines! =

Are you a Publisher? Are you an avid blogger? Then, you probably want to
[deliver to every reader a more engaging and relevant reading
experience](http://wp-abtesting.com/nelio-ab-testing-publishers/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing includes is **the first A/B testing tool for WordPress that
offers Headline Experiments**. Given a post in your site, create alternative
titles, excerpts, and featured images, and discover which combination gets more
visitors to click the link and further read the post from anywhere in your
site!


= #4 - Test Widgets =

**Nelio A/B Testing is the only solution that includes Widget Testing**. Easily
duplicate your current widget set, change it by adding new widgets, removing
old widgets, and editing others, and discover which widget combination improves
your conversion rate.


= #5 - Beautiful Heatmaps and Clickmaps =

**[Heatmaps (and Clickmaps) offer valuable
information](http://wp-abtesting.com/heatmaps-teach-us/?fp=wordpress.org) about
what your visitors do and don't do** when they land to your website. Also, they
are a perfect companion of A/B experiments, for they give insights on what to
text next and help you understand the progress of your experiments.


= #6 - Test Alternative Themes and CSS =

If you're planning to change your theme, or tweak its CSS rules, [make sure
they'll benefit your
business](http://wp-abtesting/add-ab-testing-clause-next-design-contract/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing makes theme and CSS testing extremely easy! Simply select
the themes you want to test (or define the alternative CSS rules you want to
apply), and the plugin will take care of the rest.


= #7 - Conversion Actions and Evolution of Your Experiments =

With Nelio A/B Testing, you can [track the important actions your visitors
take](http://wp-abtesting.com/powerful-analytics/?fp=wordpress.org). Don't get
lost with tons of irrelevant options and data. Focus on what matters. Our
plugin will offer you fresh information about the evolution of the experiment,
with nice graphics about visitors and conversions.


= #8 - Cache Support and Server Load =

One of our priorities is **efficiency**. The process of A/B testing a site is
not necessarily at odds with performance. Nelio A/B Testing implements several
mechanisms to reduce the impact of testing your site, such as a **Performance
Must-Use Plugin** (that reduces response times of any AJAX request triggered by
Nelio), **support for cache systems** in WordPress, and **optional site-wide
consistency** (if you're testing a page or post, not only that page or post has
to change, but also any page that includes a widget referencing it).


= #9 - Outstanding Support =

We work very hard to offer an amazing support to all our customers. If you
encounter compatibility issues or you have problems setting the plugin up and
running, contact us and we'll do our best to help you!


= #10 - Subscription Plans that Fit Your Needs =

Nelio A/B Testing aims to offer a **complete A/B testing experience for
everybody**. That's why [you can create an **unlimited number of experiments of
any kind** subscribing to any of our
packages](http://wp-abtesting.com/subscription-plans/?fp=wordpress.org). Just

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is
done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a
well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates
and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the
winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically
significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single
button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually
modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning)
alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The "testing unit" in a generic tool is the web
page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to.
A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress
specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many
more coming!

== Changelog ==

= 3.3.5 =
* Bug fix with quota computation.
* Small improvements.


= 3.3.4 =
* Bug fix. CSS experiments now load alternatives properly (both during
experiment execution and preview).
* Bug fix. When creating Heatmap experiments, the _Create_ button is disabled
only when required.


= 3.3.3 =
* POST-loaded pages are no longer A/B-tested. Otherwise, we may compromise
the POST data.
* Bug fix. Some original pages where marked as alternatives, which means that
they are not available when the plugin is deactivated nor for creating new
experiments. We fixed this.


= 3.3.2 =
* Improved Performance. Several AJAX requests are no longer directed to your
own WordPress server, but to our backend servers. This way, we reduce your
server's load and boost the overall performance.


= 3.3.1 =

can be tested (i.e. alternatives are properly loaded).
* We reduced the amount of calls required to sync headline-related tracking
information.
* Bug fix: latest update broke alternative loading for the landing page. This
is now fixed.
* Bug fix: when viewing the progress of an experiment, we now say there's a
winner if (a) the original version is the best or (b) there's an alternative
that's better than the original (even though it's "as good" as other
alternatives).
* We added a small warning when the plugin is updated reminding users to clean
their caches.


= 3.3.0 =
* **New Feature - Widget Testing** Nelio A/B Testing is the first tool to

your pages and posts, even if they have not been published yet.
* **Improvement - Consistent Experience** When creating A/B tests, you can make
sure that the proper titles, excerpts or featured images are properly used all
over your site. Don't focus only on the tested page, but everywhere.

experimental support for caching alternative content. Instead of simply
bypassing cache mechanisms, you can now take full benefit from them.

* And several additional improvements and bug fixes.

to be notified (Enterprise users only).

having a winner based on the comparison between the best alternative and the
original (not two alternatives).
* Improvement: when creating/editing an experiment, users are now prompted
before they leave with unsaved changes.
* Improvement: external page accessed actions can now be "indirect". If the

conversion properly.

upgraded.
* Several improvements and bug fixes.

defined is now preserved.

as the external goal's URL).
* Quick fix. In the progress of the experiment page, goals created with
previous version of the plugin have useful names (instead of "Undefined").
