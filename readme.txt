= Reasons for choosing Nelio =

Take a look at the following reasons for choosing
Nelio A/B Testing!


= #1 - Native A/B Testing Solution for WordPress =

There's no [need to learn an external
tool](http://nelioabtesting.com/5-reasons-use-nelio-ab-testing/?fp=wordpress.org).
Define, manage, and track the progress of your experiments directly from within
WordPress. Nelio A/B Testing provides a **lovely and well-known user
interface** that simplifies the process of creating alternatives and applying
the winning ones.


= #2 - Create Alternative Content for your Pages (and Posts) =

When creating A/B experiments, the first things you'll want to test are the
pages of your website. Does this button work? Do my visitors go from the
landing page to my pricing page? What if I change this background image? Nelio
A/B Testing makes [page (and post) experiments super
easy](http://nelioabtesting.com/wordpress-splitmultivariate-testing-pages/?fp=wordpress.org)!


= #3 - Go beyond simple title tests&mdash;Test Headlines! =

Are you a Publisher? Are you an avid blogger? Then, you probably want to
[deliver to every reader a more engaging and relevant reading
experience](http://nelioabtesting.com/nelio-ab-testing-publishers/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing includes is **the first A/B testing tool for WordPress that
offers Headline Experiments**. Given a post in your site, create alternative
titles, excerpts, and featured images, and discover which combination gets more
visitors to click the link and further read the post from anywhere in your
site!


= #4 - Test Widgets =

**Nelio A/B Testing is the only solution that includes Menu and Widget
Testing**. Use the WordPress' default user interface for creating new menus and
widget sets. You'll be able to duplicate your current menus and widgets, and
modify them with just a few clicks. Discover which combination improves your
conversion rate!


= #5 - Beautiful Heatmaps and Clickmaps =

**[Heatmaps (and Clickmaps) offer valuable
information](http://nelioabtesting.com/heatmaps-teach-us/?fp=wordpress.org)
about what your visitors do and don't do** when they land to your website.
Also, they are a perfect companion of A/B experiments, for they give insights
on what to text next and help you understand the progress of your experiments.


= #6 - Test Alternative Themes and CSS =

If you're planning to change your theme, or tweak its CSS rules, [make sure
they'll benefit your
business](http://nelioabtesting.com/add-ab-testing-clause-next-design-contract/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing makes theme and CSS testing extremely easy! Simply select
the themes you want to test (or define the alternative CSS rules you want to
apply), and the plugin will take care of the rest.


= #7 - Conversion Actions and Evolution of Your Experiments =

With Nelio A/B Testing, you can [track the important actions your visitors
take](http://nelioabtesting.com/powerful-analytics/?fp=wordpress.org). Don't
get lost with tons of irrelevant options and data. Focus on what matters. Our
plugin will offer you fresh information about the evolution of the experiment,
with nice graphics about visitors and conversions.


= #8 - Cache Support and Server Load =

One of our priorities is **efficiency**. The process of A/B testing a site is
not necessarily at odds with performance. Nelio A/B Testing implements several
mechanisms to reduce the impact of testing your site, such as a **Performance
Must-Use Plugin** (that reduces response times of any AJAX request triggered by
Nelio), **support for cache systems** in WordPress, and **optional site-wide
consistency** (if you're testing a page or post, not only that page or post has
to change, but also any page that includes a widget referencing it).


= #9 - Outstanding Support =

We work very hard to offer an amazing support to all our customers. If you
encounter compatibility issues or you have problems setting the plugin up and
running, contact us and we'll do our best to help you!


= #10 - Subscription Plans that Fit Your Needs =

Nelio A/B Testing aims to offer a **complete A/B testing experience for
everybody**. That's why [you can create an **unlimited number of experiments of
any kind** subscribing to any of our
packages](http://nelioabtesting.com/subscription-plans/?fp=wordpress.org). Just
check our subscription plans and select the one that better suits your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is
done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a
well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates
and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the
winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically
significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single
button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually
modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning)
alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The "testing unit" in a generic tool is the web
page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to.
A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress
specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many
more coming!

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.0 =
* **Efficiency Improvements**. We've redesigned several components of our
plugin from scratch. Now it's faster and more reliable! We've solved most of
the compatibility issues our plugin had with some JavaScript libraries and
Frameworks (such as, for instance, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or
Angular.js).

* Added new JS funtion <code>NelioAB.delay</code>. With this function, one can
delay the execution of some JavaScript code (surrounding that code with
<code>NelioAB.delay( function(){</code> and <code>}</code>. This prevents
JavaScript code from being executed twice (one for the original content and
another one for the alternative's).

upgraded.
