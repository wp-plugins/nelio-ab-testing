A/B Testing, conversion rate optimization, and beautiful Heatmaps specifically
designed for WordPress.


== Description ==

[Nelio A/B Testing](http://wp-abtesting.com) is a conversion optimization
service for your WordPress site. It helps you define, manage, and keep track of
**A/B-testing experiments**, combined with powerful and beautiful **Heatmaps**.
Get everything you need from within your WordPress dashboard, where you'll
benefit from a lovely, integrated, and familiar user experience. Since we
designed the tool specifically for WordPress, you will have complete control on
what you test: pages, posts, themes, titles... and many more that will be
available in future releases!

**Version 3.0** is the first big update of Nelio A/B Testing since we first
launched it. It uses a new user interface that is faster and easier to use.  It
also includes many efficiency and stability improvements.

**Note** Please keep in mind that [you will need an
account](http://wp-abtesting.com/subscription-plans/) to use our plugin (the
service includes a 14-day free trial period).

= Features =

* **There's no need to learn an external tool!** The definition, management,
and tracking of experiments is beautifully integrated in WordPress. Nelio A/B
Testing provides a lovely user interface that simplifies the process of
creating alternatives and applying the winning ones.
* **Nelio A/B Testing is a powerful A/B Testing tool.** Test alternatives for
your pages and posts or modify the look and feel of your website testing
different themes or tweaking the CSS files.
* **Heatmaps as the perfect companion for A/B Testing** Understand more about
your website and your customers using our Heatmaps feature. Use Heatmaps to
know the spots in which your users pay more attention or to discover what they
are ignoring!
* **Understand what's going on with your site.** Get fresh information about
the evolution of the experiment every day, with nice graphics about visitors
and conversions. Detailed statistical information is also available if you want
it. Otherwise, the plugin summarizes the key information for you.
* **Don't worry about your server performance.** Gathered information about
experiments and statistical calculus are stored and performed in Nelio's
backend servers.

can be adapted to tailor your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is
done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a
well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates
and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the
winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically
significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single
button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually
modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning)
alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The "testing unit" in a generic tool is the web
page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to.
A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress
specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many
more coming!
